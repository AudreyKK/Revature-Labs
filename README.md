# Revature-Labs

All the labs can be found in the src folder. Most of them are in their assigned week,
and the commit message should state the topic they cover.

### Notes on UnitConverter 
Source for gravity factor on different planets: https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/planet_table_ratio.html

I realize I am playing sort of fast and loose with the terms 'weight' and 'mass'.
(weight = mass * gravity).
And also that translating weight from planet to planet may not actually count as
a unit conversion, I just thought it was fun.
